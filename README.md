Some results of lane detection according to eight different scenarios of the CULane dataset. Note that results for the “Cross” scenario are excluded in this example since it does not contain lanes. From top to bottom (scenarios) : Normal, Crowd, Night, No line, Shadow, Arrow, Highlight, and Curve. From left to right (results) : input images with the ground truth (green color), results by ENet, SCNN, SAD, and the proposed method.
